        <h1>“Pioneers in permanent immersive technology!”</h1>

            <p>Immersion Process:</p>
          <p>With the rise of the dependence on artificial intelligence systems like Siri and SmartHome  systems, and the immense personalization of social media sites in the late 2010’s and early 2020’s, we started developing assistive technologies to give personal suggestions based on <strong id="yellow">user behavior in real time. </strong>
            <br>During this time we provided these suggestions and useful content through our <strong id="green">mobile application with over 10 million users.</strong> We began to invest in the development of wearable technology such as <strong>Smart Glasses, contacts, prosthetic eyes and watches.</strong>

            </p><br><p>
            In 2035 we had a major breakthrough, <strong>the first completely successful SmartEye installation surgery! </strong> This technology was first developed to assist people with memory issues such as short term memory loss and dementia. Once the general public began to express discontent with the physical disconnect between themselves and SmartGlasses and SmartContacts, they began to request SmartEye installation surgeries. At first many SE users opted to only have one eye installed and the other remain natural, this is no longer a popular trend seeing as now most users opt for both eyes installed. Many enjoy the SE for the ability to<strong> customize your eye color </strong>and frequently make appointments to change the iris or wiring color. 
            </p><br><p>
            The natural eyes that are kept in our carefully controlled and secure storage facilities, and users are welcome to visit their natural eyes upon appointment.
